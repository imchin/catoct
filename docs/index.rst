CATOCT
========

CATOCT is a toolbox for generating a continuous-acceleration time-optimal cubic trajectory.
Given a sequence of (multiple-degree-of-freedom) via points in joint space and limits on the magnitude of both velocity and acceleration of each degree of freedom, 
the goal is to generate a piece-wise cubic trajectory that is time-optimal and satisfies both velocity and acceleration constraints. The trajectory must be 
continuous in position, velocity, and acceleration.
